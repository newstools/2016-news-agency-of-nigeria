By Yemi Idris The Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), said it had dedicated 20 megawatts to industrial customers in Kano to enhance power supply for effective operations. The Managing Director of the company, Alhaji Jamilu Gwamna, gave this assurance while inaugurating a new industrial feeder at Tamburawa in the outskirts of Kano on Saturday. According to him, the new feeder, which has the capacity to carry 20 megawatts, is dedicated to companies in the area in order to improve their operations. He said the decision to dedicate the feeder to the companies was necessary in view of the multiplier effects it would have on the economy of the state and the country at large. “We must focus on industrial customers because of the multiplier effects. If they are in operation, they will provide job opportunities to a number of people,” he said. According to him, the dedicated lines will supply power to livestock, rice millers and milk production companies . This, he said, would enhance the rice value chains, as rice millers and milk production companies would benefit and become more productive. “It is our hope that the project will open a new chapter of relationship between KEDCO and its industrial customers in Kano,” he said. He added that with the commissioning of the N20 million feeders, KEDCO would realise a lot of revenue from the companies in the area. Gwamna said that the company would determine the consumption of the companies and add load to the feeder, which he called a ‘Virgin Feeder’. He expressed the hope that many people would come and establish companies in the area in order to get maximum benefits. Gwamna, however, called on the customers to ensure prompt settlement of their bills so as to enable the company serve them better.
