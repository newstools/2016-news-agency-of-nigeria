By Bassey Bassey Rescue workers are battling to evacuate victims in a church building which collapsed in Uyo on Saturday while service was in session. Some senior government officials are suspected to be among the victims. The casualty figure has yet to be known. Latest report said about 60 people may have been killed by the collapse. The official figure of the dead has yet to be released. The collapsed church belonged to  Reigners Bible Church International. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the state governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, who was a participant in the church service,  escaped unhurt when the church building collapsed. The governor was the special guest of honour at the elevation and consecration service of the founder of the church, Apostle Akan Weeks, to the rank of bishop. In a statement, the Chief Press Secretary, Mr Ekerete Udoh, said the state government would constitute a panel of inquiry into the cause of the accident. He said the inquiry was necessary to forestall a re-occurrence of such incident and to bring to book persons found to have compromised professional standards in building construction. Udoh said the governor was touched by the unfortunate incident and personally supervised the rescue operations and evacuation of the injured to the hospital. He said the state government would foot the bill for the medical treatment of all the victims of the collapsed church building. Udoh appealed to citizens of the state to remain calm, pray for those injured and avoid undue speculations as the situation was being given the best possible attention. Witnesses said some 60 people were victims of the accident but the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Cordelia Nwawe, said the profiling of victims was still ongoing.
